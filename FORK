Things that may be useful to keep alive in a fork:

* Keywords/Subject/Content-ID/etc (that is, use standard headers where applicable)
** Reason not in main: psycotica0 disagrees that this is useful
* redo-blog style template system. Gets rid of the need to generate so many template scripts
** Reason not in main: psycotica0 prefers having redo do all filname-based recognition
* Nicer file extensions.  Is this still even necessary?

Things I want to do and maybe mainline:

* More template system options (mustache, especially).  Maybe modularise this designed more.
* More *.compile (now called *.typeconvert?) scripts
* Permalinks (this may just be part of how templates treat things)
* Stable ATOM ids for sure
